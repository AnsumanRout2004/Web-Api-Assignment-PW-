    "    Q1: What is an API? Give an example, where an API is used in real life.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules that allows different software applications to communicate with each other.\n",
    "    It acts as an intermediary between different systems or components, enabling them to exchange data and functionalities.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Example: Payment gateways like PayPal or Stripe provide APIs that allow e-commerce websites to integrate payment services without handling transactions directly.\n",

    "def q2():\n",
    "    return \"\"\"\n",
    "    Q2: Give advantages and disadvantages of using API.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Advantages:\n",
    "    1. Automation: APIs enable automation by allowing software systems to interact without human intervention.\n",
    "    2. Efficiency: APIs allow developers to use existing functionalities instead of developing from scratch.\n",
    "    3. Scalability: APIs facilitate easy expansion and integration of new features.\n",
    "    4. Security: APIs allow secure data exchange by defining access rules.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Disadvantages:\n",
    "    1. Security Risks: APIs expose endpoints that can be exploited if not secured properly.\n",
    "    2. Dependency: Applications relying on third-party APIs are affected if the API changes or goes down.\n",
    "    3. Complexity: Some APIs require extensive documentation and learning curves.\n",

    "    Q3: What is a Web API? Differentiate between API and Web API.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    A Web API is a specific type of API that is accessed over the internet using HTTP protocols. It enables communication between web-based applications and services.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Differences:\n",
    "    1. API: A general term referring to any interface that allows communication between software components.\n",
    "    2. Web API: A subset of APIs that operate over the web and use HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.\n",

    "    Q4: Explain REST and SOAP Architecture. Mention shortcomings of SOAP.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    REST (Representational State Transfer):\n",
    "    - Uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for communication.\n",
    "    - Data is exchanged in formats like JSON or XML.\n",
    "    - Stateless architecture improves scalability and flexibility.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol):\n",
    "    - Uses XML format for message exchange.\n",
    "    - Relies on strict standards for security and transactions.\n",
    "    - Operates using the SOAP protocol over HTTP, SMTP, or TCP.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Shortcomings of SOAP:\n",
    "    - More complex due to extensive standards.\n",
    "    - Slower due to XML parsing.\n",
    "    - Less flexible compared to REST.\n",
